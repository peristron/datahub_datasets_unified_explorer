🔗 Brightspace Dataset Explorer

A Unified Schema Intelligence Engine for D2L/Brightspace Data Hub.

    Deployed: [Streamlit Cloud Link]
    Status: Production Ready (v2.1)

This application is a "Rosetta Stone" for Data Engineers, Analysts, and Architects working with Brightspace Data Sets (BDS). It bridges the gap between the raw Knowledge Base documentation and actionable SQL/Python code, providing a visual and interactive way to explore the complex Entity-Relationship model of the LMS.
🚀 Key Features
1. 🎛️ Experience Modes

    🟢 Quick Explorer: A streamlined interface for general users. Focuses on the Dashboard, Visual Map, and AI Assistant.
    🔷 Power User: Unlocks the full engineering toolkit, including the SQL Builder, Schema Browser, KPI Recipes, and UDF Flattener.

2. 🗺️ Interactive Relationship Map

    Visualize the invisible: See how tables connect via Primary and Foreign Keys (PK/FK).
    Modes:
        Network Graph: Force-directed graph showing direct connections.
        Solar System: "Category" suns with dataset planets (good for discovery).
        Heatmap: Density matrix of connections.
    Export: Download high-res PNGs or GraphViz (DOT) files for external diagramming tools.

3. ⚡ Query Builder (SQL & Python)

    Automated Joins: Select 2+ datasets, and the engine calculates the shortest join path using NetworkX.
    Polyglot Output:
        SQL: Generates JOIN syntax for T-SQL, Snowflake, or PostgreSQL.
        Python: Generates pandas.merge() code for data scientists working with CSV exports.

4. ⚙️ Smart Data Management

    Integrated Scraper: Fetches the latest schema definitions directly from the D2L Community Knowledge Base.
    Backup & Restore: Download a snapshot of the current metadata schema as a CSV for offline analysis or version comparison.

5. 🔧 UDF Flattener

    The Problem: D2L stores custom user data (e.g., Pronouns, Dept ID) in EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) tables.
    The Solution: Generates the complex MAX(CASE WHEN...) SQL required to pivot these rows into clean columns.

6. 🤖 AI Data Architect

    Context-Aware: The AI uses the current schema metadata to answer questions about the data model.
    Secure: Only metadata (column names/types) is sent to the LLM. No actual row data ever leaves your browser.

🛠️ Setup & Installation

Prerequisites: Python 3.9+

    Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/brightspace-explorer.git
cd brightspace-explorer

Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure Secrets:
Create a file at .streamlit/secrets.toml:

toml

# Password to unlock AI features
app_password = "your_secure_password"

# API Keys (Optional - user can enter in UI if not set here)
openai_api_key = "sk-..."
xai_api_key = "..."

Run the App:

Bash

    streamlit run unified_dataset_explorer.py

🚦 First Run / Initialization

When you launch the application for the first time, it will be empty because no schema metadata has been loaded yet.

    Open the Sidebar on the left.
    Expand the ⚙️ Data Management section.
    Click 🔄 Scrape & Update All URLs.
    Wait approx. 30 seconds for the scraper to fetch definitions from the D2L Knowledge Base.
    Once complete, the dashboard will populate, and you can begin exploring.

📂 File Structure

    unified_dataset_explorer.py - The main application monolith (streamlined for Streamlit Cloud).
    dataset_metadata.csv - The cached schema definitions (generated by the internal scraper).
    requirements.txt - Python package dependencies.

🔗 The Ecosystem

This tool is part of a larger Data Intelligence suite:

    Brightspace Explorer: (This Tool) For Schema Mapping, SQL Gen, and Architecture.
    Signal Foundry: For Unstructured Text Analysis (Discussion posts, Survey comments).
    CSV SQL Tool: For rapid ad-hoc querying of flat files.

⚠️ Limitations & Caveats

    Metadata Only: This tool operates on the documentation of the datasets, not your live database. It cannot preview rows of data.
    Standard Schema: Custom columns created by your SIS integration (e.g., Oracle_ID_Custom) will not appear here, as they are not in the public D2L Knowledge Base.
    Manual Field IDs: For the UDF Flattener, you must manually input your specific Field IDs (e.g., 4, 9) because the scraper cannot see your private configuration values.
